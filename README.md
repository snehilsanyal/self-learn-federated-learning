# 🏫🙋🏻 Self Learn Federated Learning

This repository contains a roadmap for beginner's to start their journey on Federated Learning. Self-curated. The difficulty will be moderate and expects prior knowledge about Python and Deep Learning concepts.

## 👋🏻 Introductory Resources

1. Start off with this funny and insightful cartoon on Federated Learning by [**Google AI**](https://federated.withgoogle.com/). The same site contains a list of learning resources and research done by Google on Federated Learning. 

2. The first paper on Federated learning was by Google Inc in 2017. The authors presented a new learning paradigm where the data remains distributed in several mobile devices but the model is trained in a decentralized way. Instead of data moving to a centralized server, the model moves to distributed devices.
Quoting from the Abstract (had to mention it lol):
> **We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on
the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by
aggregating locally-computed updates. We term
this decentralized approach Federated Learning.**

Read the blog first: [**Federated Learning: Collaborative Machine Learning without Centralized Training Data**](https://research.google/blog/federated-learning-collaborative-machine-learning-without-centralized-training-data/)paper here: [Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v54/mcmahan17a/mcmahan17a.pdf)

3. The next paper is again by Google Research. This time the paper deals with Keyword Prediction
